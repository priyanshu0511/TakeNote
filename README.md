# **TakeNote ‚Äì A MERN Stack Note-Taking App**

TakeNote is a full-stack web application that allows users to securely create, view, edit, and delete personal notes. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js), it provides a simple and clean interface with user authentication and private dashboards. Each user‚Äôs notes are accessible only to them after logging in.
